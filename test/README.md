sn_git_sync
===========

What
----

sn_git_sync  (or `sngit`) is a tool for syncing a simplenote user's set of notes with a github repository.

How
---

When run, it will query either side and, depending on which is newer, update the other.

Why
---

I want this because I prefer to use git to manage my writing when I'm at a workstation, and simplenote when I'm mobile.  I also plan to experiment with storing my notes in data structures that are more complex than a list of notes (dictionaries, graphs, etc...).

Once the basic sync functionality is complete, I will add the ability to run a user-provided script on sync, which may make modifications before updating either data store.

Status
======

Incomplete

Unless you'd like to contribute a lot of code, I wouldn't recommend trying to use this yet.
